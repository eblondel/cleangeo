Description:
  Provides a set of utility tools to inspect spatial objects, facilitate
  handling and reporting of topology errors and geometry validity issues. 
  Finally, it provides a geometry cleaner that will fix all geometry problems, 
  and eliminate (at least reduce) the likelihood of having issues when doing 
  spatial data processing.
