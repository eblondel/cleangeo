#' @title Clean Geometries from Spatial Objects
#'
#' @description cleangeo provides a set of utility tools to inspect spatial objects, facilitate handling and 
#' reporting of topology errors and geometry validity issues.  Finally, it provides a geometry 
#' cleaner that will fix all geometry problems, and  eliminate (at least reduce) the likelihood 
#' of having issues when doing spatial data processing.
