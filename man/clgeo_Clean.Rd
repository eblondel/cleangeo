\usage{
clgeo_Clean(sp, errors.only = NULL, strategy = "POLYGONATION",
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sp}{object extending the \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}}
as defined in \pkg{sp}}

\item{errors.only}{an object of class \code{vector} giving the types of errors
for which the output should bounded. Default value is NULL (\emph{i.e.} the output
will include features for which both errors and errors were raised.). At now, this
argument accepts the error type \code{"ORPHANED_HOLE"}.}

\item{strategy}{advanced strategy to clean geometries. Default is "POLYGONATION",
alternate value is "BUFFER" (old method).}

\item{verbose}{Indicates wether the clean logs have to be printed. Default
value is FALSE.}
}
\value{
an object extending the \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}}
as defined in \pkg{sp}, with cleaned geometries.
}
\description{
Function to clean a spatial data collection
}
\note{
About cleaning strategy:
The polygonation method is a tentative alternate method to triangulation to clean
geometries and to the classical often used 'buffer' approach. In the polygonation
method, triangulation is skipped and a re-polygonation intuitive algorithm is
applied to rebuild the source invalid geometry into one or more valid polygonal
geometries.
