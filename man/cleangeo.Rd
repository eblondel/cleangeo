\title{Clean Geometries from Spatial Objects}
\description{
cleangeo provides a set of utility tools to inspect spatial objects, facilitate handling and 
reporting of topology errors and geometry validity issues.  Finally, it provides a geometry 
cleaner that will fix all geometry problems, and  eliminate (at least reduce) the likelihood 
of having issues when doing spatial data processing.
